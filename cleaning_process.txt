Cleaning process
1.There was not too much to clean since the data had significant missing data 
2.The data had proper data type, hence absolutely nothing was done to the data type
3.But to get the number of people the review has helped, i had to use the excel text to columns to split the helpful count
field
4.It had something like this, '455-helpful count'
5.I used the demlimeter to get the number out of the split
Thats how i was able to clean the data
